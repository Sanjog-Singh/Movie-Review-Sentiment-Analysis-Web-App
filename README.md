# NLP-Fusion
NLP Fusion is a Web App built using Machine Learning Techniques and Streamlit.<br>
This Web App takes a user input of a movie review, one similar or different question pair and a message you received and shows you the sentiment of the entered review, whether the question pair is similar or not and whether the message is spam or not respectively.<br>
This project is applicable mostly on all type of the reviews, not for the movie reviews only and also the message could be a SMS or Email.<br>
Note:- Two CSV Files namely 'IMDB Dataset.csv' and 'questions.csv' are not there in the repository because of it's size, so you can download from the below link.<br>
